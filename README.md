Pac-n-Zoom
==========

This is an Android project that allows users to turn photos into animations.

This code is currently a work in progress. 

In this commit, the code will allow the user to select a picture. When the "Animate" is selected, the thumbnails 
from the cloud are displayed. The tags are loaded, but they are not used, yet. The user can type in a tag. The
test case is "Bee" which is case sensitive. When "Send" is selected, only the thumbnails that have a "Bee" tag
are displayed.

In the next commit, the user will select a thumbnail. The original picture is displayed, and the animation
that was represented by the selected thumbnail will play on the picture that was initially selected.
